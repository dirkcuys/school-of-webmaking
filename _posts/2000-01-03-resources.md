## Making as Learning

>..the best maker-driven learning is never just about the making. It’s about all the things that happen around the making. That initial spark of curiosity, the investigation and early tinkering, the planning and research that follow, the inspirations and appropriations from other projects, the prototypes, the failures, the feedback, and, perhaps most importantly, the iterations upon iterations towards a better make. All of these acts are done in and contingent on well configured social contexts, in communities of practice and affinity spaces. 

--Rafi Santo, "[Is Making Learning? Considerations as education embraces the Maker Movement](http://empathetics.org/2013/02/12/is-making-learning-considerations-as-education-embraces-the-maker-movement/?)"

### Trying and Tinkering in the Making Process

### Different Styles of Making

>"This aspect of Anne's work -- her close, almost tactile involvement with the sprites -- enables us to make a bridge between styles of programming and styles, this time, not of moral discourse, but of doing science. The fact of diverse styles of expert programming supports the idea that there can be different but equal voices even where the formal has traditionally appeared as almost definitionally supreme: logic, mathematics, and the "hard" sciences."

--Sherry Turkle and Seymour Papert, "[Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete](http://www.papert.org/articles/EpistemologicalPluralism.html)"

### Connected Learning
> At the core of connected learning are three values: 
>>Equity — when educational opportunity is available and accessible to all young people, it elevates the world we all live in. 

>>Full Participation — learning environments, communities, and civic life thrive when all members actively engage and contribute.

>>Social connection — learning is meaningful when it is part of valued social relationships and shared practice, culture, and identity.

### Openness 

> Rather, the Open Movement is an umbrella term that describes a number of overlapping and interrelated movements that, collectively, support the idea of a free and open society in the Arts, Education, government, computing/code, research, technology, medicine, copyright/copyleft, and other key areas. 

-- ETMOOC's ["The Open Movement – Open Access, OERs & Future of Education"](http://etmooc.org/blog/2013/03/02/topic-4-the-open-movement-open-access-oers-future-of-education/)

> The goal of open is:

>>*participation.* rocket fuel for smart collaboration.

>>*agility.* speed. flexibility. getting shit done.

>>*momentum.* communities want to push boulders that are already rolling.

>>*testing and rapid prototyping.* iterating and refining as we go.

>>*leverage.* getting greater bang from limited resources. punching above our weight.

-- Matt Thompson, ["How to Work Open"](http://openmatt.org/2011/04/06/how-to-work-open/)
