# Reflecting on our experiences and creations leads us down the path to life-long learning.
Write or make your reflections and share them with the [Webmaker Community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/).


* Who do you imagine your audience to be? Can you reach them in #teachtheweb? How can #teachtheweb help you reach them elsewhere? With whom do you most need to playtest your work?
* How can your #teachtheweb work connect to the rest of your calling?
* How is #teachtheweb a playtest for expanding your teaching?
* How do we situate what we've learned about web authoring and teaching the web in our work with other learners?
* How can you help your audience  and yourself cultivate the awareness to identify and report on "bugs" in teaching and learning?
* Why does encouraging feedback from your audience lead to improved learning designs
